IO4 Quad Optical/IR Detector baseboard

Derived from Geoff Bunza's SMA Detector, published in his column in MRH as "SMA23 – A New DCC & DC Car & Loco Detector – Differential Absolute Position Detector (DAPD)"

This version eschews "small" in favor of a remote mountable IO4 baseboard that can be mounted near the point of use, and then use [sensors disguised as ties](/pages/IO4-IR-Detector-GBunza-Fingers.html) for the sensor electronics themselves.


It has 4 independent optical detectors for high density applications.  4 Circuit Enhanced Optical Position Detector uses an Arduino ProMini (included) for its timing and de-bounce, so these parameters can be changed in software.


The output is an open drain (2N7002) which can sink up to 115mA @ up to 48V.


This design uses Geoff's self-calibrating detection circuit, so you
don't need to adjust for ambient light level.  Note the circuit
won't work in the dark unless you provide an infrared illumination
source.  The supply voltage range is 5 volts and the the output is
an open drain (2N7002) which can sink up to 100mA @ 48V.
